                <h3>Enter the Norse realm</h3>
                <p>His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. 
                    It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same.</p>

                <h3>A second chance</h3>
                <p>Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, 
                   he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.</p>

                <h3>A darker, more elemental world</h3>
                <p>From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, 
                   and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods.</p>

                <h3>Visceral physical combat</h3>
                <p>With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, 
                    fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and gruelling. 
                    A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a 
                    vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.</p>
